### OVERVIEW
![](IMAGES/studio%20set.jpg)

  Over-The-Top (OTT) is a media distribution model that has gained popularity in recent years. It allows content providers to deliver television shows, movies, and videos directly to viewers via the Internet, bypassing traditional distribution methods such as broadcast, cable, and satellite TV providers. By using OTT platforms, content creators can reach a global audience without the need for intermediaries, giving them more control over their content and a broader reach. OTT service providers have various ways of acquiring new content to offer to their subscribers. The three primary methods are Purchasing Content, Producing Content, and Licensing content. Each of these approaches has its advantages and challenges. Purchasing existing content can provide immediate access to popular titles while producing original content allows the platform to build a unique brand identity. Licensing content can offer a cost-effective way to expand the content library, but it might come with restrictions or competition from other platforms seeking the same content.

   This disruptive distribution model has transformed the media landscape and altered the way audiences consume entertainment content. Major players in this industry are Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Prime Video, ESPN +, and HBO Max to name but a few. Another Key player interested in this industry is Microsoft who has seen all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. My goal in this project was to analyze box office movies  and translate the findings into actionable insights that Microsoft can use in decision-making in regard to their new venture of creating a new movie studio.



### BUSINESS PROBLEM
Microsoft's decision to venture into the movie industry presents exciting opportunities, but also potential challenges due to their lack of experience in creating films. To ensure a successful entry into this competitive market, it is important for them to understand the types of movies that are currently thriving at the box office. Analysis of the current trends and translating these findings into actionable insights, Microsoft can make informed decisions on the types of films it should produce to maximize its chances of success.


### THE DATA
11 Datasets were compiled by the school for the project from the below sources for this analysis:

Box Office Mojo

IMDB

Rotten Tomatoes

TheMovieDB

The Numbers

I did an Analysis on the combined data sets (tmdb_movies_budgets_df(TMDB dataset) and movies_df(IMDB dataset)) seeking to answer key questions that will help Microsoft Studio make the right decisions. I am seeking to understand the most produced genres of movies, and the correlation between the production budgets and revenue.

In the analysis, I am also examining the impact of Release Timing on a movie's success, along with other factors like budget and release month.

###  RESULTS

### TOP GENRES AND RATINGS.
A successful movie studio is typically characterized by several key factors that contribute to its achievements and long-term viability
These factors include:
1. High-Quality Content: Producing films that resonate with audiences and critics alike is crucial. Consistently delivering well-made, engaging, and innovative movies. It was important to analyze the genres' distribution and their ratings so Microsoft Studio can produce movies that captivate viewers and leave a lasting impression.Drama and commedy are the most commonly produced movies. Microsoft should be keen on how the distibution of the produced movies and can opt to combine popularly produced genres with most votes like drama and top genres with highest averange ratings which can be a viable strategy for their movie studio

    A successful movie studio understands the importance of diversifying its film portfolio. 
 By producing a range of genres and styles, the studio can attract different audience demographics and increase its potential market reach
