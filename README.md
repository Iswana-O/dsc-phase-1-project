### OVERVIEW
![](IMAGES/studio%20set.jpg)

Over-The-Top (OTT) is a media distribution model that has gained popularity in recent years. It allows content providers to deliver television shows, movies, and videos directly to viewers via the Internet, bypassing traditional distribution methods such as broadcast, cable, and satellite TV providers. By using OTT platforms, content creators can reach a global audience without the need for intermediaries, giving them more control over their content and a broader reach. OTT service providers have various ways of acquiring new content to offer to their subscribers. The three primary methods are Purchasing Content, Producing Content, and Licensing content.Each of these approaches has its advantages and challenges. Purchasing existing content can provide immediate access to popular titles, while producing original content allows the platform to build a unique brand identity. Licensing content can offer a cost-effective way to expand the content library, but it might come with restrictions or competition from other platforms seeking the same content.
This disruptive distribution model has transformed the media landscape and altered the way audiences consume entertainment content. Major players in this industry are Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Prime Video, ESPN +, and HBO Max to name but a few. Another Key player interested in this industry is Microsoft who has seen all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. My goal in this project was to analyze box office movies  and translate the findings into actionable insights that Microsoft can use in decision-making in regard to their new venture of creating a new movie studio.



### BUSINESS PROBLEM
Microsoft's decision to venture into the movie industry presents exciting opportunities, but also potential challenges due to their lack of experience in creating films. To ensure a successful entry into this competitive market, it is important for them to understand the types of movies that are currently thriving at the box office. Analysis of the current trends and translating these findings into actionable insights, Microsoft can make informed decisions on the types of films it should produce to maximize its chances of success.
